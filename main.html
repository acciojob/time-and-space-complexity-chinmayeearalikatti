    <h1>Time, Space and Complexity </h1>
    <p>Time complexity measures how the runtime of a program grows with the size of its input. Below are approaches to analyze and write time complexity for a given code or program.Time complexity are fundamental concepts in analyzing the efficient of algorithms in data structures and algorithms (DSA).</p>

    <p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory that an algorithm requires to run, based on its input size. It includes both the memory needed for the input values and the auxiliary space used during execution and it is represented by O(n).</p>
